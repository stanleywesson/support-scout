# Standesk Feature Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the Standesk application, organized by priority. Focus is on building practical features that enhance learning while creating a polished, production-ready application.

## Phase 1: Build the Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Objective:** Decouple the UI from hardcoded data by creating a mock API layer.

- [x] **Create a Mock API Service:**
    - [x] Establish a new `src/api` directory.
    - [x] Develop a `mockApi.ts` service to manage data (tickets, agents) in memory.
    - [x] Expose functions that simulate real API calls (`getTickets`, `addTicket`, etc.), returning Promises.
- [x] **Refactor Pinia Stores:**
    - [x] Update all stores to fetch and manipulate data by calling the mock API service instead of using hardcoded values.

## Phase 2: Core Ticketing Features (Mostly Complete)

**Objective:** Build out the essential features for managing tickets.

- [x] **Implement Full Ticket Lifecycle:**
    - [x] Allow agents to update a ticket's status, priority, and assigned agent from the `TicketView`.
- [x] **Add Comments/Discussion:**
    - [x] Create a component to display comments on a ticket.
    - [x] Add a form to allow users to add new comments.
- [ ] **Implement Ticket Filtering and Sorting:** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
    - [ ] Add dropdown filters for: Status (Open/In Progress/Closed), Priority (Low/Medium/High/Urgent), Agent
    - [ ] Add sort options: Creation Date (newest/oldest), Priority (high to low, low to high)
    - [ ] Display active filter/sort selections with clear buttons
    - **Learning focus:** Computed properties, array methods (filter, sort), reactive state
    - **Estimated time:** 2-3 hours
- [ ] **Add Ticket Search:** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
    - [ ] Search bar that filters tickets by title or description
    - [ ] Implement debouncing (wait 300ms after user stops typing)
    - [ ] Show "No results found" message when search returns nothing
    - [ ] Works in combination with filters above
    - **Learning focus:** Reactive search, debouncing, VueUse library

## üéØ Recommended Order of Implementation

For optimal learning and progressive enhancement:

1. **Fix Priority 0 Technical Debt** (Do this first - foundation for everything else)
2. **Add Filtering & Sorting** (Makes the app actually usable)
3. **Add Search** (Complements filtering perfectly)
4. **Separate Loading States** (Better UX during operations)
5. **Input Validation** (Professional touch, important skill)
6. **Statistics Dashboard** (Fun, visual, impressive)
7. **Basic User Login** (Makes it feel like a real app)
8. **Bulk Actions** (Advanced feature, good challenge)
9. **Export to CSV** (Quick win, useful feature)
10. **Dark Mode** (Fun polish, looks great in portfolio)
11. **Deploy to Production** (Share your work!)

## üìù Notes

- **Each feature builds on previous work** - don't skip phases
- **Fix technical debt as you go** - don't accumulate more issues
- **Write tests for new features** - practice TDD
- **Focus on completing features** - better to have 5 polished features than 15 half-done ones
- **This is a learning project** - prioritize features that teach new concepts
